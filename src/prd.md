# Hydrate-on-View Demo - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: Demonstrate efficient component hydration based on viewport visibility for optimizing performance in large lists.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Components mount only when visible in viewport
- Components unmount when leaving viewport  
- Smooth scrolling performance with 100+ items
- Memory usage remains optimal

**Experience Qualities**: Performant, Educational, Smooth

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)

**Primary User Activity**: Interacting - users scroll through a list to observe hydration behavior

## Thought Process for Feature Selection

**Core Problem Analysis**: Large lists of components can cause performance issues and high memory usage when all components are mounted simultaneously.

**User Context**: Developers and technical users wanting to understand viewport-based component hydration patterns.

**Critical Path**: Page load â†’ Scroll through list â†’ Observe hydration/dehydration â†’ Understand performance benefits

**Key Moments**: 
1. Initial page load showing static previews
2. First scroll revealing hydrated components
3. Scrolling away and seeing components unmount

## Essential Features

### Viewport Detection
- **What it does**: Tracks which components are visible in the viewport using Intersection Observer
- **Why it matters**: Enables precise control over when components should be active
- **Success criteria**: Components detect visibility with 200px margin for smooth transitions

### Dynamic Component Mounting
- **What it does**: Mounts React components only when they enter the viewport
- **Why it matters**: Reduces initial render cost and memory usage
- **Success criteria**: Components render smoothly without flickering

### State Management
- **What it does**: Manages data loading and component state via Zustand
- **Why it matters**: Ensures data persistence and efficient updates
- **Success criteria**: Data loads once and persists across component mount/unmount cycles

### Static Previews
- **What it does**: Shows lightweight previews when components are not hydrated
- **Why it matters**: Maintains layout and provides visual feedback
- **Success criteria**: Previews are visually distinct but maintain list structure

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Clean, technical, educational
**Design Personality**: Minimal and precise
**Visual Metaphors**: Dashboard-like layout emphasizing the technical demo nature
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface focusing on the core demonstration

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with subtle blue accents
**Primary Color**: oklch(0.45 0.15 247) - Professional blue for branding
**Secondary Colors**: oklch(0.96 0.01 247) - Light gray for secondary elements
**Accent Color**: oklch(0.94 0.02 247) - Subtle highlight for interactive states
**Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and technical competence
**Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
- Background (oklch(0.98 0.005 247)) + Foreground (oklch(0.15 0.01 247)) - 15.8:1 ratio âœ“
- Card (oklch(1 0 0)) + Card-foreground (oklch(0.15 0.01 247)) - 16.7:1 ratio âœ“
- Primary (oklch(0.45 0.15 247)) + Primary-foreground (oklch(0.98 0.005 247)) - 8.2:1 ratio âœ“

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) for consistency
**Typographic Hierarchy**: 
- H1: 2rem, font-bold for main title
- Body: 1rem, font-normal for descriptions
- Small: 0.875rem for meta information
**Font Personality**: Clean, readable, technical
**Which fonts**: Inter from Google Fonts
**Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at all sizes âœ“

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
**Attention Direction**: Center-aligned header draws focus, then vertical list flow
**White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding and margins for breathing room
**Grid System**: Simple container with max-width constraints
**Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with container padding adjustments
**Content Density**: Balanced - enough content to demonstrate but not overwhelming

### Animations
**Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions for component state changes
**Hierarchy of Movement**: Focus on smooth mounting/unmounting transitions
**Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal animations to not distract from the technical demonstration

### UI Elements & Component Selection
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for individual items
- Dashed borders for static previews
- Skeleton loading states for pending hydration
**Component States**: Clear visual distinction between hydrated and static states
**Icon Selection**: Emoji icons (ðŸ“±, âœ¨) for friendly visual cues
**Spacing System**: Consistent 1rem (mb-4) spacing between items

### Accessibility & Readability
**Contrast Goal**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

**Potential Obstacles**: 
- Network delays in data loading
- Rapid scrolling causing mount/unmount thrashing
- Memory leaks from improper cleanup

**Edge Case Handling**: 
- Error boundaries for failed hydration
- Debouncing for scroll events
- Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

**Technical Constraints**: 
- React 18+ for createRoot API
- Modern browsers supporting Intersection Observer

## Implementation Considerations

**Scalability Needs**: Pattern should work with thousands of items
**Testing Focus**: Performance monitoring and memory usage validation
**Critical Questions**: How does this pattern perform under stress testing?

## Reflection

This approach is uniquely suited for educational demonstration because it provides immediate visual feedback on a complex performance optimization technique. The design makes the technical concept accessible while maintaining professional presentation standards.
